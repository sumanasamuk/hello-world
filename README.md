My ideas, discussions and knowledge sharing
Hello there, people call me Sumana. 
In this edit I want to talk a little bit about sea walrus because 
a) when all else fails, you can always talk about an animal 
b) Sea walruses spend half their time on land and other half in water 
c) They have 4 flippers! 
Oh, by the way, a female sea walrus is called a 'cow'.
